# Apify GitHub Actions

This repository contains reusable GitHub Actions used in internal Apify projects.

## How to release new version

1. Create a PR. **IMPORTANT: Avoid using the `chore:` prefix, as it doesn't work with RELEASE-PLEASE. Use `feat:` or `fix:` instead.**
2. Merge PR into the main branch after approval. This triggers an automated workflow that generates a new PR for the release using the RELEASE-PLEASE action.
3. Navigate to the PR and merge it into the main branch. This will publish the release with an updated changelog.
